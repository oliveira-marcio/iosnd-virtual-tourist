# Virtual Tourist

Fifth project of [Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003). 

This project consists of working with [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata) and [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) where the app will allow users to add pins on the main map by long press a selected location and each pin will display downloaded public photos around the location. All data (including images) will be persisted.

**Technical Approach**

- `MapKit` was used to display maps and pins.
- `Core Data` was used to manage local persistence.
- [flickr.photos.search](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html) was used to get public photos by given coordinates.
- `URLSessionDataTask` was used for HTTP requests
- `JSONDecoder` and `JSONSerialization` was used for JSON parsing
